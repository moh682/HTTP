        <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
        1. What is your public IP address right now, and how did you find it?
        <p>through terminal: curl ipinfo.io/ip = ip right now “212.10.19.74“</p>
        <p>public ip is the ip that the router uses to communicate with the internet.</p>
        <br>
        2. What is your private IP address right now (do this both at home and in school), and who/what gave you that address?
        <p>through terminal: ifconfig = ip right now  “192.168.87.103” this is the ,</p>
        <p>adresse that the router use to communicate with the local devices.</p>
        <br>
        3.What’s special about these address ranges?
            10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
            172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 
            92.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
        <p> all private address</p>
        <br>
        4. What’s special about this ip-address: 127.0.0.1?
        <p>this is the localhost. the computer itself</p>
        <br>
        5. What kind of service would you expect to find on a server using these ports: 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 443?
        <p>22: SSH </p>
        <p>23: telnet </p>
        <p>25: SMTP - simple mail transfer protocol (email)</p>
        <p>53: DNS - Domain name system</p>
        <p>80: HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol</p>
        <p>443:  HTTPS - HyperText Transfer Protocol with, TLS or SSL (security).</p>
        <br>
        6. What is the IP address of studypoints.dk and how did you find it?
        <p>Terminal: “ping (web Application)”. ip address: 165.227.137.75</p>
        <p>or "nslookup studypoints.dk" in terminal </p>
        <br>
        7. If you write https://studypoints.dk in your browser, how did “it” figure out that it should go to the IP address you discovered above?
        <p>Through DNS servers.</p>
        <br>
        8. Explain shortly the purpose of an ip-address and a port-number and why we need both
        <p>The purpose for an ip-address is the same, the address on a letter. by adding an address to a letter it gives </p>
        <p>the transport company knowledge on where to send it. the port, will tell the software, in what category it </p>
        <p>should search in. by searching in port 80, it know its http, by 22 its SSH and so on. </p>
        <br>
        9. What is your (nearest) DNS server,?
        <p>in the System Settings on mac, you can go to network->DNS-> and you can view your current DNS server. </p>
        <p>otherwise you can install namebench in terminal, and view the most optimal DNS server for you, through </p>
        <p>namebench.</p>
        <br>
        10. What is (conceptually) the DNS system and the purpose with a DNS Server?
        <p>there are a lot of DNS servers out there. there are .com .dk .org .net and many more. each has a server, to </p>
        <p>administrate on. when you type a domain name in the url section, the dns server search for the ip-address of</p>
        <p>that domain name, if it finds it will redirect, otherwise it will throw a code 404 “cannot be found” exception.</p>
        <br>
        11. What is your current Gateway, and how did you find it?
        <p>my current gateway : 192.168.87.1</p>
        <p>found it through terminal: netstat -nr | grep '^default'</p>
        <br>
        12. What is the address of your current DHCP-Server, and how did you find it?
        <p>DHCPDiscover - Looks for a DHCP server</p>
        <p>DHCPOffer - The DHCP server offers an address</p>
        <p>DHCPRequest - The host requests to lease the address</p>
        <p>DHCPACK - DHCP server sends the IP addresses to the host</p>
        <p>my current DHCP ip-address is : 192.168.87.103 , found it through system settings -> network -> TCP/IP</p>
        <br>
        13. Explain (conceptually) about the TCP/IP-protocol stack
        <p>TCP/IP protocol are protocols that allow devices to communicate with each other.  and HCP/IP is a protocol ,</p>
        <p>which make it so not every device is connected directly, but is connected through the router. </p>
        <p>this means that a non-routable protocol is that every device is connected directly to the internet, means </p>
        <p>devices doesn't need a router, it has its own local ip-address</p>
        <br>
        14. Explain about the HTTP Protocol (the following exercises will go much deeper into this protocol)
        <p>HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the </p>
        <p>foundation of any data exchange on the Web and a client-server protocol, which means requests</p>
        <p>are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from </p>
        <p>the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more</p>
        <p>http are request and responses. it is going through client  - > proxy - > proxy -> server, and visa versa. </p>
        <br>
        15. Explain (conceptually) how HTTP and TCP/IP are connected (what can HTTP do, and where does it fit into TCP/IP)
        <p>HTTP is in the application layer, were it can understand the data that has been received and is being packed </p>
        <p>to be sent. after it has packed the data, it gives it to the transport layer where TCP/IP is located, with the </p>
        <p>packed data, it knows which port and address to be sent to. then it goes to internet layer where it is packed </p>
        <p>with the dns package, then later the network access layer where then its sent to the internet, and so on </p>
        <p>when receiving the information, it goes the same ladder and down again. </p>
